# HASHERLIFE

## TODO

- [ ] implement actual hashlife (use IDs / handles as keys into HashMap -> pass around IDs)
- [ ] use references instead of IDs / handles (lifetime problems...)
- [ ] refactor Leaves to be on level 3 and be represented as Bool8x8 or u64 resp.
- [ ] create CLI
- [ ] integrate some patterns from <https://conwaylife.com/wiki> like "Kok's Galaxy" or a "Unitcell"
